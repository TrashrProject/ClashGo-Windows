# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.5.0-beta] - 2026-09-16

### Added
- **Deploy budget — the deploy phase is now wall-clock bounded**
  (`internal/attack/attack.go`). `StartDeployBudget` arms a deadline
  (~2× the longest legitimately-observed full deployment) and every
  reconcile / sweep / verify loop consults `DeployBudgetExhausted()`
  between rounds. Observed live before this: a spent Earthquake card whose
  cooldown icon never reads "empty" kept the sweep re-firing taps for
  ~2 minutes *after* the battle had ended. Leftover slots are now reported
  as undeployed so the attack report shows the partial failure instead of
  a phantom success.
- **`end_at_percent` per-strategy auto-end** (`pkg/strategy/yaml_parser.go`,
  `internal/attack/attack.go`) — a strategy can declare the destruction
  percentage at which the win is already secured (e.g. `valk_spam.yaml`
  ends at 50%). In threshold mode the stall timer is deliberately disabled
  *below* the threshold so a stall can never abandon the win early, and the
  battle only ends when the red **End Battle** button is actually on screen.
- **Battle-outcome correctness** (`internal/attack/attack.go`):
  `LastDestructionPercent` latches the highest destruction read during the
  battle (monotonic, so a transient 0 as the overlay renders can't win),
  `ThDestroyed` latches the golden "Town Hall destroyed" banner from an
  optional `stall_config.th_banner_zone`, and `StarsFromOutcome` scores
  stars from the outcome (≥50% = 1★, TH = +1★, 100% = 3★) when the result
  panel's OCR fails. `ResetBattleOutcome` clears both at the top of
  `WaitForBattleEndCtx` — live, battle 1's garbage 381% read was still
  latched when battle 2's result was parsed, turning a 32% defeat into
  "3 stars".
- **`StateConnectionLost` + `StateConfirmExit`** (`internal/game/types.go`,
  `internal/game/classifier.go`, `internal/bot/bot.go`) — the disconnect
  dialog (TRY AGAIN / RETURN HOME) was misread as `StateBattleEnd`, so the
  bot tapped result-screen coordinates forever (live: 18:26 boot → 18:28
  ReturnHome fallback → 18:33 restart loop). TRY AGAIN reconnects in
  place; the quit-confirm dialog is dismissed with CANCEL.
- **Saved-army slot selection** (`cmd/`… `internal/bot/bot.go`,
  `pkg/strategy/yaml_parser.go`) — strategies declare `army_slot` and
  `selectArmySlot` clicks that recipe card in the army list (measured
  geometry: first card at ref-y 227, ~54px stacking). `valk_spam.yaml`
  targets the 4th recipe.
- **Inter-attack cooldown** (`min_seconds_between_attacks`, default 30s)
  — without it the bot re-attacked ~8s after every Return Home with
  whatever the camps held (live: three near-identical defeats in under
  four minutes).
- **BlueStacks adbd wedge workaround** (`internal/adb/transport.go`,
  `internal/adb/shellpipe.go`). In the wedged state adbd answers every
  bare command with `FAIL "closed"` while compound commands
  (`getprop x; <cmd>`) run normally. `shellWedgeFallback` rewrites the
  service string, `stripPrefixLine` drops the extra output line, and the
  exec-service path falls back to `shell:` (with a 16→12-byte screencap
  header normalizer) — the wedge survives `adb kill-server`, so this is
  the only durable fix at the transport layer.
- **`screenSize` recovery ladder** (`internal/bot/bootorchestrator.go`) —
  a failed `wm size` now escalates retry-transport → `adb kill-server` +
  start-server between attempts instead of burning the budget against the
  same wedged socket.
- **Phase-level deploy offset propagation** (`internal/attack/deploy_planner.go`,
  `pkg/strategy/yaml_parser.go`) — a phase pin like `offset: 130 # Deeper
  in for EQs` now applies to every unit in the phase (per-unit `offset`
  still wins).
- **Post-deploy spell reconciliation** (`internal/attack/spell_deployer.go`)
  — `Amount: "All"` resolves to the card's live OCR count (11 rage on one
  card, 4 EQs on another) instead of a hardcoded 5, and
  `VerifyAndReconcile` re-reads the slot afterwards and re-fires the
  difference. A no-progress stop (two identical positive reads) and a
  zero-OCR-streak bound stop a spent card from eating taps forever.
- **`cmd/wedge_probe`** — standalone live harness for the adbd-wedge
  detection + compound-command fallback.
- **Test coverage for every new decision path** — `deploy_budget_test.go`,
  `battle_end_test.go` (destruction → stars, trophy/star pixel anchors,
  defeat fixtures), `spell_deployer_test.go` (tap-level assertions + formula
  geometry), `slot_manager_test.go` (duplicate manual-label hijack),
  `testharness_test.go`, `bootorchestrator_test.go` (wm-size fallback),
  `classifier_stuck_test.go`, `formula_test.go`, `yaml_parser_test.go`, plus
  Python strategy-contract tests (`tests/test_spell_placement.py`,
  `tests/test_valk_strategy.py`) wired into `make test`.

### Changed
- **Loot OCR is content-located, not slot-located**
  (`internal/game/loot.go`) — loot rows are found by detecting bright,
  low-saturation connected components (the white/gold digits) inside a
  generous search zone and grouping them into horizontal text lines, so the
  reading no longer depends on fixed HUD geometry. Digit ROIs get relaxed
  padding for narrow columns (the League Bonus gold was read 10× low when
  the right edge clipped the trailing digit), and implausible reads are
  rejected instead of being fed to the stall timer.
- **Frame loop 10 Hz → 4 Hz** (`internal/bot/bot.go`) — during a battle the
  deploy and battle-end goroutines run their own captures at their own
  cadence, so the full-screen classify at 10 Hz was mostly redundant
  (~55ms captures + classify pinned a core). 4 Hz still catches the result
  overlay fast enough for ReturnHome and the stuck-watchdog.
- **ArmyCamp rule hardened** (`internal/game/classifier.go`) — the lone
  brown pixel anchor also passed on ordinary village frames (live:
  `(479,149) = RGB(61,53,62)`), which made `processFrame` press Back on the
  real village and open the quit-confirm dialog the bot then sat on for the
  5-minute boot grace; the rule now requires both army-overview tab-header
  anchors, and a frame that still shows the real Attack! button is treated
  as the main village and never Back-pressed.
- **Battle-search / bonus ROIs widened** (`assets/battle_loot_rois.json`) to
  match the new content-located loot reader.
- **`make test`** now runs the full contract suite — `go vet`, Go tests
  (with the local OpenCV `LC_RPATH` injected via `pkg-config`), and the
  Python strategy tests, with a graceful skip when no pytest-capable
  interpreter is present.
- **`valk_spam.yaml`** declares `end_at_percent: 50` and `army_slot: 4`.

### Fixed
- **Fabricated 3-star victories** — the destruction-rule read used to
  OVERRIDE the result panel's parsed stars, so a garbage stall-ROI percent
  (381%, 851%, 991%) turned live defeats into wins. The visual parse is now
  ground truth and the rule read is only a fallback when the panel parse
  fails outright.
- **Star art read as victory on the defeat screen** — the result-panel star
  parse is now two-pass and defeat-safe; pinned by the new
  `internal/game/testdata/screen_defeat.png` fixture.
- **Stale `manual_labels.json` entries creating duplicate unit identities**
  (`internal/attack/slot_manager.go`) — a manual label now loses to a
  template match on a *different* slot. Live, a stale "grand warden" label
  on the unidentified Dragon Duke slot stole the warden's main-phase deploy
  and the Duke was never swept (it looked deployed).
- **`wm size` wedge aborting the boot** — falls back to the live
  screencap's header for authoritative pixel dimensions (this is the same
  fix family as 0.4.0's boot fallback, now with the retry ladder above).
- **Pipe read deadline left armed after service negotiation**
  (`internal/adb/shellpipe.go`) — the idle `discardReader` inherited the
  shell-timeout deadline and marked a perfectly healthy pipe broken
  ("adb shell pipe reader stopped: i/o timeout") mid battle-end wait.

### Verified
- Full live session on BlueStacks Air (860×732, SM-G998B profile): boot →
  classify → attack search → loot OCR → EDrag Rush and Valkyrie/EQ runs →
  result parse (stars derived from destruction, defeat fixture matched) →
  graceful shutdown.
- `make test` green: `go vet` clean, all Go packages pass, 24/24 Python
  strategy-contract tests pass.

## [0.4.0-beta] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- **Frame-hot-path template matching is single-scale by default**
  (`internal/vision/vision.go`) — `MatchTemplate` no longer blindly
  escalates every call to a 5-step multi-scale search (0.8–1.2). That
  escalation cost 5 `Resize` allocations + 5 cgo matches per call on the
  per-frame path. Callers that genuinely need density-scale tolerance
  call `MatchMultiScale` explicitly (named templates hit the scaled
  template cache). Expected effect: per-frame template matching cgo work
  drops from 5×N to N matches (N = templates checked).
- **Pooled result Mats on the classifier and loot-OCR paths**
  (`internal/game/templates.go`, `internal/game/loot.go`) — the result
  Mat for `MatchTemplate` results now comes from the shared vision Mat
  pool (`vision.GetMat`/`PutMat`) instead of `gocv.NewMat()` + `Close()`
  per template per frame. Zero result-Mat heap allocation on the
  classifier tick and loot OCR hot paths.
- **Persistent ADB shell pipe is now enabled by default**
  (`internal/config/config.go`) — `UseShellPipe: true`. Removes the
  ~100–300ms `app_process` JVM spin-up per tap during attack cycles
  (measured 30–80ms/command on USB, more on WiFi ADB). Automatic
  fallback to the legacy one-shot transport is verified
  (`routeTap` → `markPipeBroken` → legacy tap path), and pipe start
  failure logs a warning and degrades gracefully.

### Fixed
- **`--once` CLI runs now exit cleanly** (`cli.go`, `internal/bot/bot.go`)
  — main() previously blocked forever on `ctx.Done()` after the bot
  finished its final attack, so a `--once` run hung with the process
  alive after the session summary printed. `Bot.Done()` exposes a
  channel that closes on graceful attack-cap shutdown, and main()
  selects on it.
- **Boot survives a wedged `wm size`** (`internal/bot/bootorchestrator.go`)
  — when the `wm size` shell call fails (BlueStacks returning
  "ADB: closed" while SurfaceFlinger still serves frames), the boot
  orchestrator now falls back to the live screencap's 12-byte header
  for authoritative pixel dimensions instead of aborting the whole
  boot and leaving the Start button dead.

### Verified
- Full end-to-end live run on BlueStacks Air (860×732): boot → calibrate
  → attack search → loot OCR → EDrag Rush attack (100% deploy, 3 stars,
  2.1M elixir) → graceful shutdown, exit code 0.

## [0.3.0-beta] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- **Auto-pop update dialog** — when a new release is published, ClashGO
  now opens the update window by itself (no pill click needed): one-click
  *Update & Restart*, SHA256-verified download, in-place bundle swap, and
  a non-dismissible restart splash. "Later" silences it for the session;
  "Skip version" silences it permanently (`web/src/components/UpdateBanner.tsx`).
- **One-command release publishing** — pushing a `v*` tag now runs
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds the macOS zip, DMG, and
  `latest.json` on a fresh runner and publishes them to a GitHub Release
  automatically. Uses only the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` — no personal
  access token ships in the app, the repo, or the artifacts.
- **Autonomous-run resilience hardening** (all live-verified on BlueStacks Air):
  - **Emulator-death recovery ladder** — when screen capture dies mid-session
    the bot now escalates transport reconnect → adb-server reset →
    BlueStacks relaunch → boot re-orchestration instead of force-stopping
    the game against a dead transport and spinning forever
    (`recoverEmulator` in `internal/bot/bot.go`).
  - **Panic containment** — recover guards around the capture frame loop and
    the attack-sequence goroutine, so one bad frame or missing asset can no
    longer kill the whole process.
  - **Nil-template fallback** — the template store degrades to an empty
    (non-nil) store when assets can't be resolved, so loot/battle OCR keeps
    running instead of panicking mid-attack (`internal/game/templates.go`).
  - **Process keepalive** — `tools/run_bot_keepalive.sh` respawns the CLI
    bot ~10s after ANY exit (panic, OOM, kill) and pins
    `CLASHGO_ASSETS_DIR` so templates/strategies resolve even under launchd
    (whose default cwd is `/`).
- **Web UI overhaul** — polished dashboard console (severity chips,
  text filter, copy, match highlighting, pause-on-hover auto-scroll),
  config view with live range validation + `role=switch` toggles + keyboard
  accessible combobox, two-step armed reset confirm, ADB status pill with
  semantic colors, analytics donut, dark-mode toggle, and an a11y pass
  (`role=log`, focus-visible rings, `prefers-reduced-motion`).
- **Human-gesture input layer** (autonomous-hardening iteration 1):
  - `adb.SwipeBezier` — low-level `sendevent` quadratic-bezier swipe with
    ease-in-out velocity (accelerate → coast → decelerate) and a random
    10-20% perpendicular arc so every drag reads as a real finger; wired
    into the navigator's village camera pans; degrades to the linear path
    on devices that can't inject raw input. Unit-tested
    (`internal/adb/bezier_test.go`).
  - `TapHuman` now emits ~1-in-5 taps as a 60-130ms press-and-release
    instead of an instant down/up pair, and hesitates with a Gaussian
    reaction delay (base 250ms / σ 70ms — mass in the 180-320ms human
    band, tail ~460ms) before committing. Hot deploy loops (`TapFast` /
    `TapAsync`) are untouched and stay fast.
  - `Navigator.IdlePan` — randomized bezier camera pan + micro-pause +
    mirrored return for idle base-wandering; throttled (~18s) in the
    bot's idle-in-village path and deliberately NOT `recordActivity`, so
    the stuck-watchdog still fires on genuinely stuck idles. Unit-tested
    (`internal/game/navigator_test.go`).
  - `cmd/swipe_probe` — standalone live-gesture verification harness
    (`launcher` / `game` / `idlepan` modes) for Phase-1 style isolated
    emulator action checks.
- **Logging** — `logs/autonomous_loop.log` records each hardening-loop
  iteration's audit findings, live-verification results, and regression
  status.
- **Post-boot splash auto-handling — the bot can now boot unattended.**
  After every relaunch, Clash of Clans shows a short splash chain (the
  "ТАР!" tap-to-continue / collect screen → the CoC castle logo, which
  sits static 1-3 min while the session connects → an optional news /
  announcement splash with a Continue button) before the village loads.
  Previously the classifier misread the collect splash's orange artwork
  as `StateBattle` (1/9 pixels), the stuck-watchdog force-stopped the
  game, and every relaunch re-showed the splash — an endless
  force-stop/relaunch loop with zero attacks. Now:
  - 3 new states — `StateTapToContinue`, `StateNewsSplash`, `StateLogo`
    (`internal/game/types.go`) with classifier rules
    (`internal/game/classifier.go`) verified at 0 distance on live
    captures and 0 false-positives on the village.
  - Auto-dismiss in `processFrame` (`internal/bot/bot.go`) — taps the
    "ТАР!" prompt text (ref 450,195) and the news Continue button (ref
    403,535), each through a single in-flight goroutine guarded by the
    atomic `splashDismissInFlight` flag. Deliberately does NOT
    `recordActivity` so a genuinely-stuck splash variant still trips the
    stuck-watchdog.
  - Boot-grace in `checkStuck` — splash states get a 5-minute window
    (the logo has no progress indicator) instead of the generic 35s
    timeout that caused mid-boot force-restarts.
  - Mirrored dismissal cases in `internal/bot/wall_upgrade.go`.
  - Live-verified: restart loop eliminated (1 startup restart vs 15+),
    splash auto-dismissals, and full attacks completing with correct
    result parsing.
- **Text-based observability tooling — the bot's "eye view" for a
  terminal-only session.**
  - `cmd/screendump` — captures the live screen (or reads a saved PNG),
    runs the bot's real classifier with per-rule pixel evidence, renders
    a color-mapped ASCII layout, probes key button pixels, and
    optionally OCRs on-screen text. `-watch` loops every 3s.
  - `tools/observe.sh` — one-shot bundle: capture + classify + color map
    + OCR, artifacts saved to `obs/<timestamp>/` with an `obs/latest`
    symlink for convenience.
  - `tools/ocr.swift` — on-device Apple Vision OCR (no tesseract / no
    network); prints `x,y,w,h | text` per recognized region in
    screenshot pixel space.
  - `cmd/classify_probe` / `cmd/result_probe` / `cmd/swipe_probe` —
    standalone diagnostics for classifier state, battle-result OCR
    parsing, and human-gesture verification respectively.
  - See `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md` for the full workflow.

### Changed
- **Massive dead-code cleanup** — removed ~16.5k lines of unreachable code
  and pruned the repo tree:
  - **Deleted the NATS event-bus subsystem** (`internal/bus`,
    `internal/agent`, `internal/geo`, `internal/world`,
    `game/enricher.go` + `game/explorer.go`, `docker-compose.yml`) — zero
    production references; NATS deps dropped from `go.mod`/`go.sum`.
  - **Removed ~35 verified-dead functions** across `attack`, `bot`, `game`,
    `vision`, `logger`, `adb`, `training`, `updater`, `strategy` — incl. the
    NDJSON log mirror, `ParseCSV`, `ClassifyStateFast`, `SpellLine`,
    `isUnitSelected`, `hasColorSignature`, `WaitForSlotEmpty`, the legacy
    `SlotManager` helpers, the validator `Planner` engine
    (`internal/attack/plan.go` + its test), `game.Calibrator`, and the
    `adb.WithDeviceID` option.
  - **Deleted 48 unreferenced `cmd/` diagnostic tools** — kept the five wired
    into Makefile/scripts (`attack_record`, `capture_template`,
    `design_attack`, `release_manifest`, `test_wall_upgrade`).
  - **Dropped dead struct fields** — `app.echo`, `transport.seq`,
    `bot.lastFrameTime`, `bootorchestrator.mu`, `recovery.onApply`,
    `updater.manifest`, `troop_counter.calibrated/scaleX/scaleY`.
  - **Consolidated duplicated logic** — `app.go` stats merge extracted into a
    `mergeStats` helper; `Transport.ExecRaw` merged into `Exec`; the
    `version.go` build-date + Makefile ldflag removed.
  - **Frontend** — fixed 4 unused-variable TS errors (`App.tsx`, `main.tsx`,
    `Sidebar.tsx`).
  - **Docs + tree** — README / DESIGN / PERFORMANCE / CHEST refreshed for the
    new layout; orphaned `assets/grab/` screenshots and stale `.gitignore`
    entries removed.

### Fixed
- **BlueStacks Air cold boot burned 90s then failed** — `waitForVMProcess`
  waited for `qemu-system`/`hd-adb` process names that never appear on
  BlueStacks Air for Apple Silicon (the VM runs in-process), so every cold
  boot hit the full wait and logged a spurious "VM did not start" failure.
  An open adb port (5555+) now counts as a VM-up signal — the same signal
  the ADB-connect wait already uses (`internal/adb/emulator_mac.go`).
- **Nil-pointer panic on missing templates** — `NewLootRecognizer` panicked
  on a nil template store when assets didn't resolve (e.g. running from a
  launchd cwd of `/`), killing the bot at attack entry. The store now
  falls back to an empty store and the attack goroutine is panic-guarded.
- **Attack History lagged the loot totals** — the history entry was only
  appended after Return Home + wall upgrades (which can take minutes), so
  the dashboard showed fresh gold/elixir totals long before the new attack
  row appeared — and the entry was lost entirely if Return Home failed.
  `executeAttackSequence` now records the report and fires the UI refresh
  at battle-result parse time (`internal/bot/bot.go`).
- **League Bonus gold misread by a factor of 10** — the bonus column's
  right padding clipped the trailing digit (bonus gold "+256 000" read as
  25600): the digit lost its right edge and its template-match score fell
  below the 0.5 floor. Narrow columns now get relaxed padding
  (`internal/game/loot.go`) and the bonus ROI's right edge was widened
  (`assets/battle_loot_rois.json`). Regression-tested via
  `TestLootVictory/screen_victory` on the tracked fixture
  (`internal/game/testdata/screen_victory.png`); the former
  `screen_victory_live.png` fixture was removed for privacy (it was a live
  capture containing real player names and was gitignored, so it silently
  skipped on fresh clones anyway).
- **Endless force-stop/relaunch loop on the post-boot collect splash** —
  the "ТАР!" tap-to-continue screen was misclassified as `StateBattle`, so
  the stuck-watchdog force-stopped the game and every relaunch re-showed
  the splash. Root cause, the mapped boot-splash chain, and the fix are
  documented in the Added entry above and in `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`.
  Verified live: restart count dropped from 15+ to 1, and the bot
  completed multiple attacks with correct result parsing.

### Fixed
- **Window close no longer freezes the app** — the async log writer now
  flushes blocked callers immediately instead of deadlocking on shutdown
  (`internal/bot/asyncwriter.go`).
- **Packaged-app Config crash** — assets are injected into the .app
  bundle for BOTH packaging paths (DMG and zip), the Config page no
  longer crashes on a nil strategies slice, and the sidebar cleanup was
  removed (`internal/paths`, `Makefile`, `web/src`).
- **`latest.json` min_supported default** — beta releases now default to
  the previous minor instead of the current version, so beta users still
  get the update banner (`Makefile`).
- **App icon + bundle signature** — ClashGO logo lands on the app icon
  and the DMG bundle is re-signed (ad-hoc) after asset injection
  (`tools/build_dmg.sh`).
- **Release workflow hardening** (all caught while shipping this release):
  - `go.sum` is now committed — it was gitignored, so a fresh CI checkout
    had no checksums and `go build` failed (`go.sum`, `.gitignore`).
  - CI pins the **`opencv@4`** formula — `brew install opencv` now ships
    OpenCV 5, which drops the `opencv4.pc` file that gocv v0.43.0 compiles
    against (`release.yml`).
  - The publish step is idempotent — re-running the workflow or
    force-pushing a tag no longer fails because the release already
    exists (`release.yml`).

## [0.2.0-beta] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **Event-agnostic chest detection** — `StateChestReward` classifier rule
  (`internal/game/classifier.go`) now fires ONLY on the `hammer`
  ("TAP TO OPEN") template match, so dark bottom pixels on a normal
  village no longer false-trigger dismissal. Survives CoC event art swaps.
- **Template-driven Continue button** — `chestContinueTap`
  (`internal/game/chestdismiss.go`) now auto-detects a `btn_continue`
  template (`assets/templates/btn_continue.png`) and taps the matched
  point, falling back to `assets/continue_button.json` only if no template
  is loaded. Removes the need for a hand-measured Continue rect. See
  `docs/CHEST.md`.
- **Device-independent CPU metric** — `internal/bot/cputime.go` reads
  process CPU time via `getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF)` (user + system) and exposes
  `cpu_time_sec` (absolute, kernel-accurate, comparable across machines)
  plus `cpu_cores` (fraction of one core over the last sample window).
  Wired into `game.SystemHealth` + `bot.BotStats`, surfaced in the GUI
  Settings view. A non-unix fallback returns zero so the build stays
  portable. See
  [`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE.md#cpu-metric-absolute-time-not-a-percentage).
- **Bot boot orchestration + ADB recovery module** — a self-contained
  BlueStacks bring-up path that survives the common failure modes on
  macOS Sequoia:
  - `internal/adb/bootprobe.go` — repeated `CaptureScreen` luma probe that
    verifies BlueStacks is past the boot animation (not just responsive to
    `adb shell`).
  - `internal/bot/bootorchestrator.go` + `bootprofile.go` +
    `boot_report.go` — orchestrates the bring-up sequence; profile
    selection is gated on prior launch results so re-runs don't retry the
    same known-failing step.
  - `internal/bot/recovery.go` — fallback recovery ladder:
    `softResetAndroid` (cheap, non-destructive `adb shell stop && start`)
    before the heavier `ResetAdbServer` (`adb kill-server && start-server`).
  - `internal/adb/emulator_mac_test.go` — table-driven tests for the
    single-launch `EnsureBlueStacksMac` path.
- **Context-aware ADB shell/capture wrappers** — `ShellWithContext`,
  `CaptureScreenWithContext`, `ExecWithContext` plus the `ShellRunner`
  interface. The context-aware variants force the transport closed on
  `<-ctx.Done()` so a 2s probe timeout can't hold the transport mutex for
  the full 30s budget.
- **`AutoDetectDevice` verifies BlueStacks** — no longer trusts
  `adb devices` verbatim. Opens a fresh transport and checks `getprop` so a
  stale `localhost:5555 device` row is skipped, plus a best-effort
  `adb connect localhost:5555` refresh.
- **`EnsureBlueStacksMac` is single-launch + smart pre-check** — scans
  candidate ports `5555..5565` (TCP-only, 2s timeouts), honors an existing
  healthy BlueStacks session (no kill+launch), then one
  `open -a BlueStacks.app` attempt. Removed the kill-and-retry path.
- **`ResetAdbServer` / `SoftResetAndroid`** on `internal/adb.Client` —
  exposed for the recovery ladder. Both documented with SAFETY notes
  (`adb kill-server` is global to the host Mac).
- **Wall-upgrade single-tap-each-X dismiss flow** — when a popup survives a
  single X tap, the bot does ONE additional tap on the alt X (if configured)
  instead of offset-jittering the same one. The `aborted` flag is now
  per-wall-iteration, and `defensiveDualTapAndLogClose` centralises the
  tap-both-X + uniform `close_failed` payload. `asset_driven_modal_*`
  events now carry `name + reason + primary_still_up + alt_still_up` and
  `primary_px + alt_px + all_up`.
- **In-app update system** — ClashGO now talks to GitHub Releases. On
  startup (and every 6h) a lightweight service checks for a new release,
  compares versions with a pre-release-aware semver, and surfaces a banner
  in the dashboard. `internal/updater` does ETag-cached polling,
  SHA256-verified downloads into
  `~/Library/Application Support/ClashGO/updates/`, Finder-open install
  plus a bundled `install_update.sh` in-place .app replacement helper.
  Every release ships a `latest.json` manifest alongside the zip, emitted
  by the new `cmd/release_manifest` helper. `make release VERSION=...`
  now produces `ClashGO-v{VERSION}-macOS.zip` + `latest.json`.
- **New diagnostic tooling** — `cmd/test_wall_upgrade` (Phase-logging
  harness), `cmd/adb_probe` / `cmd/boot_debug` (bring-up probes),
  `cmd/capture_template` (template ROI capture), plus `tools/picker.py`
  + calibration scripts documented in `tools/CALIBRATION_README.md`.
- **`docs/CHEST.md`** — capture + tuning workflow for chest/continue
  templates and the detection rule.
- **Classifier detection tests** — synthetic-frame guards that the chest
  rule fires on a chest screen and does NOT false-positive on MainVillage.
- **Resource-usage documentation** — README, `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`, and
  `docs/DESIGN.md` carry RAM/CPU estimates for ClashGO alone and combined
  with BlueStacks at 860×732 / 160 DPI (incl. the 15 FPS battle case).

### Changed
- **`auto_edrag_rush.yaml` switched to `target_edge: "Random"`** — picks a
  random corner per attack for an unpredictable per-attack landing side,
  ideal for unattended runs. Backward compatible: `"Rotate"` (deterministic
  cycle), specific corner names, and legacy side names still work.
- **Per-corner formula override workflow** — `Formula.CornerOverrides`
  (`map[string]map[string]UnitEntry`, omitempty) holds optional per-corner
  overrides authored via `cmd/design_attack -corner BL/TR/TL`. The
  orchestrator (`DeployDynamicV2`) merges a per-corner override with `Units`
  per-unit and uses the result INSTEAD of mirroring when present — fixing
  the "mirror lands too close to the red line on BL/TR/TL" symptom. See
  `docs/formula-authoring.md`.
- **`Formula.MirrorForCorner(targetEdge)`** — reflects every `P` / `P1` /
  `P2` / line point across the screen axes (`BottomRight: identity`,
  `BottomLeft: mirrorX`, `TopRight: mirrorY`, `TopLeft: mirror both`).
  Accepts full + abbreviated corner names plus a substring fallback.
- **`Formula.LoadFile(path)`** — loads a formula from a direct path, used
  by `cmd/design_attack -verify`.
- **`cmd/design_attack` is the one-stop authoring/verify tool** —
  `-live` captures from adb directly (no pre-saved PNG needed),
  `-verify <formula.json>` renders a 2×2 mirror grid saved to
  `verify_grid.png`, `-corner <BR|BL|TR|TL>` picks the authored corner.
  Required-flag check now fails fast before the capture.
- **Removed 5 redundant strategy files** — `top_edrag_rush.yaml`,
  `bottom_edrag_rush.yaml`, `left_edrag_rush.yaml`,
  `right_edrag_rush.yaml`, `balloon_edrag_rush.yaml` were single-side
  variants of `auto_edrag_rush.yaml`. `valk_spam.yaml` is kept (different
  attack system — FourSides Valkyrie ring).
- **Build metadata via ldflags** — the version string is injected at
  compile time into `main.version` so `bot_cli --version` and the Wails GUI
  show the same value. The Makefile picks up `VERSION` from `wails.json`.
- **Stray PNG cleanup** — removed untracked runtime debug artifacts
  (`verify_grid.png`, `last_failure.png`, `last_battle_result.png`,
  `diag_*.png`).

### Fixed
- **Chest Continue tap timing** — `chestContinueTap` now waits for the
  button to render and retries the tap (up to `chestContinueMaxTaps`,
  default 3) with a settle between attempts, because the overlay can lag
  the chest-open animation by ~1s and a single early tap classifies as a
  transitional `Unknown`. On final failure it dumps
  `debug_chest_continue_fail.png` for ROI recapture.
- **MatPool key collision (silent corruption)** — `getPoolKey` previously
  cast dimensions to a single `rune`, collapsing distinct sizes (e.g. rows
  100 vs 256) into one key and risking panics / mis-sized Mats. Keys are
  now encoded numerically (`%d_%d_%d`).
- **Frame-encode Mat leak** — the Live View encode path now closes the JPEG
  buffer on every branch and always returns the pooled half-frame Mat, so a
  failed encode cannot leak it.
- **`lastNav` global race** — moved the ArmyCamp navigation cooldown
  tracker from a package-level `var` to a `Bot` field, removing
  cross-instance state sharing / data races.
- **`Health().LastCapture` lied** — now reports the real last successful
  capture time instead of `time.Now()` on every call.
- **Attack-history wipe on read error** — the in-memory `historyCache`
  (seeded from disk at `NewBot`) is now the source of truth, so a transient
  `attack_history.json` read failure can no longer silently drop all prior
  attacks.
- **Duplicated ROI switch** — extracted `Bot.buttonROI()` so the
  wait-for-button and find-and-click paths share one definition.
- **`MirrorForCorner` failed for abbreviated corner names** — replaced
  `strings.Contains` substring matching with a switch on the normalized
  corner name covering full + abbreviated forms.
- **Mirror pointer-aliasing in `runVerify`** — `MirrorForCorner` mutates
  `*Point` in place, so 4 sequential mirrors on shared pointers collapsed
  to TL geometry. Fixed by deep-copying points and lines per iteration.
- **2×2 grid scaling in `runVerify`** — quadrants are at `w/2 × h/2`;
  `ApplyScreenScale` is applied after the mirror so deploy lines land on
  the quadrants.
- **Required-flag check happened after the live capture** — missing
  `-strategy` wasted an adb screencap before showing usage. Reordered.
- **Theme defaults to light** instead of honoring OS
  `prefers-color-scheme` — macOS dark default + `bg-zinc-950` produced an
  indistinguishable-black surface (perceived "black screen"). The Settings
  view lets users opt back into dark.
- **`safeEventsOn` defensive wrapper** — `EventsOn` no longer throws
  synchronously when `window.runtime` is undefined (the Wails runtime
  bridge isn't present during `npm run dev`), so the React tree no longer
  unmounts on the failure path.
- **`UpdateBanner` Rules-of-Hooks violation** — the SHA256-flash effect was
  placed after three early returns, so its hook index varied across renders
  and React threw "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render".
  Hoisted above all early returns.
- **Sidebar brand swap** to `clashgo-logo.png`.

### Performance
- **Audit-driven perf pass** — zero behavior changes, multiple-order-of-
  magnitude CPU/RAM reductions across the bot + UI. Full rationale +
  methodology in [`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE.md):
  - Removed dead `b.OnFrame` EventsEmit (`live_feed`) — up to 10 FPS in
    battle state, every emit pushing a 50–150 KB base64 JPEG through
    WailsIPC to zero React subscribers. **~7–15% battle-state CPU freed,
    ~5–15 MB transient RSS eliminated.**
  - Removed `bot_log` EventsEmit in `WailsLogWriter.Write` — every zerolog
    line generated a wasted WailsIPC round-trip. **~1–3% CPU freed.**
  - Tab-gated screenshot poll — the 1 Hz interval now only mounts on the
    Live View tab. **~0.1–0.3% continuous CPU saved.**
  - `vision.MatchMultiScaleROICached` keyed by rule name — fixes the
    empty-name bypass that re-allocated 3 scaled-template Mats per call
    (180 alloc/free per second eliminated). **~1–2% CPU freed.**
  - `world.MinWriteInterval` 250 ms → 1 s — 4× fewer tmp+rename flushes.
    **~0.5–0.8% CPU freed.**
  - `GetAttackHistory` in-memory cache — no more disk re-read on every
    0.5 Hz React poll. **~0.1–0.2% CPU freed.**
  - Detached heavy teardown in `StopBot` — UI Stop now returns ~10–50 ms
    instead of 1–3 s. **~95% Stop-IPC latency cut.**
- **Aggregate battle-state estimate** — **~10–20% CPU freed + ~10–20 MB RSS
  + ~40–60% GC-cycle reduction** during battle state. Idle (bot on, no
  battle) saves ~3–5% CPU. **Verify on your machine** with the recipe at
  the bottom of [`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE.md).

### Security
- **`.gitignore` covers `rotation_state.json`** — runtime state of the
  `Rotate` cycle. Not code, not committed.
- **Downloads are verified against the SHA256 in `latest.json`** before the
  apply step. Mismatches abort cleanly and the corruption file is removed.
- **macOS quarantine + ACLs are stripped** on the bundled helper before
  relaunch, avoiding Gatekeeper's "damaged" error.
