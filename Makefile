# stage-app injects the read-only assets (templates, strategies) and the

# (ad-hoc). This is required BEFORE both packaging paths so every
# artifact the user can install — the DMG and the zip — ships with a
# working assets dir and a valid bundle signature:
#
#   - Without this, build-zip would zip the raw wails .app, whose
#     Contents/Resources holds only the icon. Installed from the zip,
#     GetAssetsDir() would resolve to an empty dir: the Config page's
#     strategy list would be empty and the bot's OCR templates would
#     silently fail to load.
#   - build_dmg.sh does its own injection into a staged copy for
#     standalone use, but the zip path never saw it.
#
# wails ad-hoc signs the bundle during `wails build`; touching
# Contents/Resources afterwards invalidates the sealed resources, so we
# re-sign here (codesign --verify --deep --strict must pass on the
# shipped app — see tools/build_dmg.sh Stage 2.5 for the full rationale).
